âœ… Correct usage (technically speaking):
Term	                Proper Use
Hotkey	                System-specific or global key binding (works anywhere)
Shortcut Key	        app-specific key combo for speeding up actions

"Hotkeys are for system-specific, not app-specific. Shortcut keys are for app-specific. But some apps use them interchangeably or 
misuse the terms."
