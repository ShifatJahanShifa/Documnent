CloudFlare: what i understood is that it is an american company which provides various services. Nowadays, the leading softwares are using its services. Such as discord, leetcode and many more. It provides services
like: CDN, DDoS mitigation, cybersecurity, reverse proxy, DNS and many more. For security purposes, almost 20% of all websites are now using cloudflare service. 
My witness: i have seen cloudflare in use in several software like yesterday when i was trying to login the leetcode site, i needed to ensure i am human. Then i saw like the process was brought by cloudflare. Since then i became curious to know
about the cloudflare. Also during the anti-quota movement in my country, i saw people were sharing pictures of cloudflare statistics when the internet was shut down. So yeah, i think i have some interest in exploring 
cloudflare a little bit. 
That's all fpr today.
